We are deploying our project using docker.

There are two ways to deploy it.

1. You can clone entire repo & run docker-compose file to build and deploy (running predictions).
With this, you can modify the source code and check for improvemnts and bugs.
Once done, build thedocker image using the container and update the code to Github.

steps:
1. Clone the repo using git clone cmd
2. Go to docker terminal, (install if not) - docker-compose build app(app is our service)
3. Once build - docker compose up app
4. This command will run the prediction on the file you gave. Its set default to default_test.csv. Can change.


2. If you want to deploy without cloning just to check results, then use these steps.

1. Go to docker terminal and run - docker build https://github.com/jaytimbadia/dockers.git#master:.
2. This command will create an image and build the project from master branch
3. After this ,run - docker run --name <name_of_container(any)> aa357841f762<image_created_name>


Docker-compose use only if you have localled your project & want to fix | improve it.
Else use docker only.
